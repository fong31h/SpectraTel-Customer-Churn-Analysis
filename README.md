# SQL-and-Tableau-Customer-Churn

 # Project 1

In this project, I investigated customer churn in a telecommunications company using SQLlite server and a Tableau dashboard.

Vodafone is a mid-level telecommunications company dealing with high levels of customer churn that are hurting its revenue upside. 
Analyzing customer information data as well as product trends have provided several key insights into the problems facing Vodafone as well as
possible solutions.
