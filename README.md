# SQL-and-Tableau-Customer-Churn

 # Project 1

In this project, I investigated customer churn in a telecommunications company using SQLlite server and a Tableau dashboard.

SpectraTel is a mid-level telecommunications company dealing with high levels of customer churn that are hurting its revenue upside. 
Analyzing customer information data as well as product trends have provided several key insights into the problems facing Vodafone as well as
possible solutions.

# Data Explanation

SpectraTel's customer data consisted of one table with the following columns:

The most important variables in this analysis were tenure (length of time contracted to SpectraTel), contract type (Month-to-Month, One-year, and Two-year), and churn rate.

# Executive Summary

SpectraTel runs a ~33% churn rate on average. This is an acceptable churn rate that allows them to hit necessary profit margins and inrease revenue thanks to customer growth. However, SpectraTel found that revenue was lower than expected in the most recent quarter and an analysis was completed to pinpoint areas of weakness and growth.

The first insight that was discovered was the weakness in Month-to-Month contracts as compared to other contract types.
